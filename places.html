            <p>Sri Lanka is one of the best travel destinations in the world. In addition, Sri Lanka is in high in world tourism rankings.Therefore knowing about the places to visit in Sri Lanka is very important before you come here.This will guide you through the highest-ranking places ever in Sri Lanka for tourism.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>As a tourism destination, Sri Lanka can compete successfully with other destinations partly
                because of its pivotal geographical position (Fernando, 2017b). Its strategic location in the Indian
                Ocean on the major air and sea routes between Europe and the Far East is an advantage to the
                country’s positioning as a global logistics hub (Sri Lanka Info, 2011). O'Hare (1994 p. 43) pointed
                out “the Island ‘controls’ (as in colonial times) routes to the Far East as well as to other
                destinations in the Indian Ocean, the Middle East, Africa and Australasia”. This geographical
                location of Sri Lanka was a reason for colonisation by three western powers, the Portuguese (1505-
                1656), the Dutch (1956-1796) and the British (1796-1948).</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p> Sri Lanka offers a plethora of options for tourists among them beach
                destinations, favourable climate, rich cultural heritage, national parks and wildlife (Lai, 2002). It
                has 1,585 km of coastline, with Hikkaduwa and Unawatuna are well known for excellent scuba
                diving. Mirissa has becomefamous for viewing of whales and dolphins, while Tangalle is being
                promoted as a diving destination. Meanwhile, Trincomalee is known for its natural harbour and
                has two relatively unexplored beaches.

He built his palace on top of this rock and decorated its sides with colourful frescoes. On a small plateau about halfway up the side of this rock he built a gateway in the form of an enormous lion. The name of this place is derived from this structure — Sīnhāgiri, the Lion Rock. The capital and the royal palace were abandoned after the king's death. It was used as a Buddhist monastery until the 14th century. Sigiriya today is a UNESCO listed World Heritage Site. It is one of the best preserved examples of ancient urban planning. </p>
